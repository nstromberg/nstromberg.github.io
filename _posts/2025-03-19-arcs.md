I am excited to announce that I was selected by the ARCS Foundation as a 2025-2026 Horejsi Scholar. This is a fantastic honor and validates the importance of our work in fair and robust machine learning. I am extremely grateful to the ARCS Foundation and Mr. Stewart Horejsi whose generous donation made the award possible.
