I am excited to announce that a paper on which I am first author was accepted to NeurIPS 2024. It is a really cool work on making fairness interventions robust to labels noise. Find the paper [here](https://nstromberg.github.io/publication/2024-06-13-knn). I am looking forward to meeting with some fantastic (future) collaborators!
