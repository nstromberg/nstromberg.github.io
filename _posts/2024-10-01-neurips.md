I am excited to announce that a paper on which I am first author was accepted to NeurIPS 2024. I am grateful to my collaborators: Rohan Ayyagari (ASU), Monica Welfert (ASU), Sanmi Koyejo (Stanford), Richard Nock (Google), and Lalitha Sankar (ASU). It is a really cool work on making state-of-the-art fairness interventions robust to labels noise. Find the paper [here](https://nstromberg.github.io/publication/2024-06-13-knn). I am looking forward to meeting with some fantastic (future) collaborators!

Additionally I am a second author on two fantastic workshop submissions with Monica Welfert (ASU) and Lalitha Sankar (ASU) which will appear as posters at WIML and AFME. They are nice works on the theoretical robustness of common fairness interventions.
