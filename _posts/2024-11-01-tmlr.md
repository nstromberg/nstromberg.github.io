I am happy to announce that my paper entitled "Robustness to Subpopulation Shift with Domain Label Noise via Regularized Annotation of Domains" has been accepted to the Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR). It's a nice work that introduces a new two-stage last layer model intervention which encourages group-fair predictions without knowledge of the groups.
