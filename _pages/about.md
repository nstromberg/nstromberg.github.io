### Bio
Nathan Stromberg is a PhD student at Arizona State University in the school of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering working with Dr. Lalitha Sankar.
Broadly, his research focuses on fairness and robustness with strong theoretical guarantees, especially justifying common heuristic choices to gain deeper understanding.
Nathan is interested in classification-driven fairness metrics and how these can inform the development of a new generation of generative models with fairness guarantees. 
Recently, his work has focused on efficient adaptation of deep models to address distribution shift and subpopulation fairness. 
He has published work at top conferences and workshops including NeurIPS, TMLR, AISTATS, ISIT, and IMLH @ ICML.
